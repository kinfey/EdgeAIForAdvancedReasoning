[![Azure AI Community Discord](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://discord.com/invite/ByRwuEEgH4?WT.mc_id=aiml-137032-kinfeylo)


This is samples for Advanced Reasoning Model in Edge AI blog series at [Microsoft Educator Developer Techcommunity](https://aka.ms/faculty) 

Note This REPO supports a series of blogs that revolves around deployment of SLMs to Edge Devices 'Edge AI' we will focus on the deployment advanced reasoning models, with different application scenarios. You can learn more in the following session [AI Tour BRK453](https://aka.ms/aitour/brk453).

In these samples we want to demostrate examples which deploy advanced reasoning models to the edge, so that they can run on edge devices with limited computing power and offline environments. 

We will be using [ONNX model](https://onnxruntime.ai/). We can use [Microsoft Olive](https://github.com/microsoft/OLive) to convert the models to ONNX Format.
